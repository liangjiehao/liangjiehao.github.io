Hi! I am Jiehao Liang (梁杰昊), currently an Master 2 student in Mathematics at Université Paris-Saclay. I did my Master 1 at École Polytechnique with advisor [Mauro Porta](https://sites.google.com/view/mauroporta). I obtained my Bachelor degree at Renmin University of China from School of Statistics. 

I am interested in homotopy theory and its connection with geometry/arithmetic.
