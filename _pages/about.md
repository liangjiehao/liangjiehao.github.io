Hi! My name is Jiehao Liang (梁杰昊). Currently, I am a Master 2 student at <ins>Université Paris-Saclay</ins>. I did Master 1 at <ins>École Polytechnique</ins> with thesis advisor [Mauro Porta](https://sites.google.com/view/mauroporta). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in statistics from <ins>Renmin University of China</ins>. 


I am broadly interested in homotopy theory and derived geometry.

## Reading

Below are some representative books/papers/notes that I found instrcutive and practical during my study of homotopy theory. 

1. [*Topological Field Theory, Higher Categories, and their Applications*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2307), Anton Kapustin
2. [*On the Classification of Topological Field Theories*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465), Jacob Lurie
> [1] provides algebraic and physical point of view of higher categories. Many intuition and motivating examples of higher categories/functors can be found in [2], for example, the formulation of higher corbodism category and fully dualizable objects.

3. [*Introduction to Infinity-Categories*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-61524-6), Mark Land
4. [*A Very Concise Introduction to Higher Category Theory and Homotopical Algebra*](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63e4f6c7360c356e958ca05f/t/65a27663dce9490f3b962efb/1705145957150/higher+category+theory.pdf), Emanuele Pavia
5. [*An Introduction to Higher Categorical Algebra*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02904), David Gepner
6. [Student Seminar on Infinity Categories](https://sites.google.com/view/jordanlevin/teaching/infinity-categories), Jordan Levin and Ran Azouri
> [3] is a great reference for a first course in infinity category which involves very concrete examples and computation. [4] is a coherently written note ranging from basic model category to algebra in infinity categories that I read over and over. [5] is in some sense a beginner-friendly baby version of Higher Algebra. [6] is a well-organized seminar on infinity category which can be used to check if one have a good command of the language of infinity category.

7. [*Higher Algebra*](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/HA.pdf), [*Kerodon*](https://kerodon.net/), Jacob Lurie
8. [*Spectra and Stable Homotopy Theory*](https://people.math.binghamton.edu/malkiewich/spectra_book_draft.pdf), Cary Malkiewich
9. [*Derived Algebraic Geometry*](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/btoen/files/2012/04/dag-ems.pdf), Bertrand Toën
10. [*Brauer groups and étale cohomology in derived algebraic geometry*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0290), Benjamin Antieau and David Gepner
> [7] is the standard reference where Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 4.8 and Chapter 7 are closedly related to my Master 1 thesis about symmetric monoidal structure on infinity categories. [8] is a "category-free" book about spectra and stable homotopy theory. I learned some very concrete constructions in stable homotopy theory including homotopy (co)limit and smash product. Many of the abstract definitions in Higher Algebra (e.g., spectrum object, ring spectra, module spectra) can be seen as a categorical generalization of classical theory of spectra. [9] is one of the standard reference for derived algebraic geometry and [10] involes an interesting topic about Brauer group in derived geometry.
