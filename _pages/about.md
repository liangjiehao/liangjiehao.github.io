Hi! My name is Jiehao Liang (梁杰昊). Currently, I am in the second year of Master study at <ins>Université Paris-Saclay</ins> funded by Fondation Mathématique Jacques Hadamard (FMJH). I did my first year of Master study at <ins>École Polytechnique</ins> with thesis advisor [Mauro Porta](https://sites.google.com/view/mauroporta). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree from <ins>Renmin University of China</ins>. 

My CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m-gMMVMBJvGW2LPWjJJ7HuZ5QY2JM0dB/view?usp=sharing).

I am interested in homotopy theory and its connection with geometry/arithmetic.
