Hi! My name is Jiehao Liang (梁杰昊). Currently, I am in the second year of Master study at Université Paris-Saclay. I did my first year of Master study at École Polytechnique with thesis advisor [Mauro Porta](https://sites.google.com/view/mauroporta). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree from Renmin University of China. My CV is [here]().

I am interested in homotopy theory and its connection with geometry/arithmetic.
